    <div id="p1">hofu - (n) [Japanese] abundance</div>
    
    <div id="p1">hofu is founded on the belief that, if there is abundance, it should be shared.</div>
    
    <div id=p3>33% - an entire third - of all the food in the United States is wasted. 10% of the food 
    in grocery stores is tossed because of "inperfections" in fresh produce, or because the
    "best by" date had passed, despite the food being perfectly healthy and edible.
    Food waste contributes to global warming, and every meal wasted is equivalent to wasting 
    all the resources and water that were used to create that meal.</div> 
  </div>
  <div class="sec2">
    <div id="p4">Simultaneously, millions of Americans are food-insecure, meaning they 
      may not know where their next meal will come from. Pre-COVID-19, in 2019, the number of food-insecure people in the USA was 35 million. 
      Today, it's 50 million. COVID-19 had drastically impacted many lives, jobs, and food situations, 
      making it important now more than ever for us to provide food to those that need it.</div>

    <div id="p5">hofu is designed to be a safe and secure way for food providers (such as grocery stores, restaurants, and farms) 
      to connect with and give "less desirable" food to food pantries. This way, that perfectly healthy and 
      edible food is not tossed and wasted, but is instead used to feed those that need food. </div>

    <div id="p6" class="bulletPoints">hofu hits 3 metaphorical birds with one stone:
    <div id="b1">- reducing food waste, reducing resource waste and slowing climate change</div>
    <div id="b2">- feeding the hungry, helping food-insecure families in America</div>
    <div id="b3">- bringing the community together by connecting local organizations</div>
  </div>
    <div id=p7>Join us on hofu in building a world where abundance is shared to those who need it.</div>
